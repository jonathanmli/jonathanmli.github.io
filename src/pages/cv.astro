    <p>
      I study the interplay between incentives, algorithms, and learning to build decision-making systems that plan, reason,
      and collaborate as well as they generalize. My research spans sequential decision making, algorithmic game theory,
      online learning, market design for data, reinforcement learning, and human-AI teaming.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am a Ph.D. candidate in computer science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (GPA 3.92/4.0), where I work with Ziniu
      Hu on self-improving LLM agents. I also collaborate with Yisong Yue as a visiting scholar at Caltech, designing
      inference-scaling methods that couple LLM reasoning with search. Recent projects include achieving human-level play in
      Avalon, scaling code generation performance beyond AlphaEvolve, and creating market mechanisms that price data and
      machine learning models responsibly.
