# Jonathan Li(ght)'s Museum 

## About me

I am a student at UChicago doing research on market design, online algorithms, and reinforcement learning. 

In the past, I have worked on programming projects including game development, deep learning, data analysis, cache server building, mathematical simulations, and reinforcement learning in games. 

I am proficient in Python, R, C++, and Mathematica. 

In my spare time, I compose design and play boardgames, compose music, and go on outdoor adventures. 

Here's a cool photo I took on my travels!

Happy to talk about any of the topics I mentioned above. You can reach me at jmzhl[at]uchicago.edu

## Coding projects

I have included links to some of the coding projects I have done in the past below. 

This [Baseball Shiny App](https://github.com/jonathanmli/bb_viz) explores the similarities between baseball batters using machine learning

I conducted mathematical research on simulating random exterior forms, and created visualization tools for mathematical objects as hypergraphs [here](https://github.com/jonathanmli/J2SummerResearch)

[Here](https://github.com/jonathanmli/weighted-experts) is a project on online learning in finance. 

You can find other interesting projects and repositories on my github [profile page](https://github.com/jonathanmli). 

## Other notes

My name online will often appear as Jonathan Light. I use Light because (1) Li is a very common last name and people often get confused (2) Light is the semantic translation of both my Chinese given name and courtesy name and (3) Light nearly preserves the lexigraphic ordering of Li.
