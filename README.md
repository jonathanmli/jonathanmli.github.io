## About me

I am a student at UChicago doing research on market design, online algorithms, and reinforcement learning. 

In the past, I have worked on programming projects including game development, deep learning, data analysis, cache server building, mathematical simulations, and reinforcement learning in games. 

I am proficient in Python, R, C++, and Mathematica. 

In my spare time, I compose design and play boardgames, compose music, and go on outdoor adventures. 

Here's a cool photo I took on my travels!

Happy to talk about any of the topics I mentioned above. You can reach me at jmzhl@uchicago.edu

## Coding projects

I have included links to some of the coding projects I have done in the past below. 

This [Baseball Shiny App](https://github.com/jonathanmli/bb_viz) explores the similarities between baseball batters using machine learning
